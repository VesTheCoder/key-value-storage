# I faced so many problems trying to set up non-mock real unit tests for my handlers, that I gave up.
# But, The project is great and I'm proud of how I managed to make it.
# Maybe I would get back to those unit tests in about 2 week and would finish them.
# For the moment, I have other things to do.
